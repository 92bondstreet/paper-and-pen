## 🥾 Challenge 0 - Start Sketching

You don't need to have studied "Les Beaux Arts" to be a great designer, but basic drawing is an important skill.
Drawing allows you to quickly explore ideas and communicate them effectively to others.


### Sketch 20 objects - 20 minutes

For each of 20 objects, **create a small, icon-sized hand-drawing (about 2 cm by 2 cm) on the A4 paper**.

You should try to spend a maximum of 1 minute on each sketch, to think fast and sketch as many as you can in the 20 minutes available.

Sketching is not about creating something beautiful: your only task is to sketch a representation of the object.
